# Changelog

## 2026-07-02 00:02:22 CST

- Published `before-you-build-skill@0.1.2` to npm and verified that the `latest` dist-tag points to `0.1.2`.
- Created GitHub release `v0.1.2 - npm npx installer` with release notes covering npm install, supported targets, and verification.
- Added post-release promotion copy for X, Hacker News, Reddit, Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, and directory submissions.

## 2026-07-01 23:34:17 CST

- Reviewed the live website and repository install-copy changes, then tightened the README compatibility table so npx is the primary setup path.
- Fixed the Codex manual install path in `docs/INSTALL.md` to match the actual installer target, `~/.codex/skills/before-you-build/`.
- Prepared patch release `0.1.2` so the npm package page can show the updated npx-first README instead of the stale `0.1.1` README.

## 2026-07-01 23:23:36 CST

- Updated README and install docs after the npm package went live, adding the npm badge, package link, and npx-first quick start commands.

## 2026-07-01 22:47:46 CST

- Normalized npm `bin` paths before first registry publish so `npx before-you-build-skill` keeps its executable entrypoint.

## 2026-07-01 22:10:39 CST

- Added an npm `npx before-you-build-skill` installer with local install targets for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Hermes, and Gemini CLI.
- Added Gemini CLI slash-command setup that writes `before-you-build.toml` and stores the full skill package as local reference material.
- Updated README, install notes, and OpenClaw guidance to document the new `npx` flow while keeping OpenClaw's native Git install path.

## 2026-06-12 19:29:38 CST

- Opened `wshobson/agents` PR #578 after the maintainer confirmed the markdown-only pre-mortem skill was a good fit and welcomed a focused PR.
- Added a single-skill `before-you-build` plugin under `plugins/`, refreshed generated marketplace metadata, and updated the public plugin and skill catalog counts.
- Updated `docs/SUBMISSIONS.md` to mark issue #565 as PR-opened and record the new PR link plus validation notes.

## 2026-06-12 19:21:13 CST

- Responded to `junminhong/awesome-agent-skills` PR #6 review after rechecking that the PR was still open and not already accepted.
- Amended the PR to remove the repo-local `SKILL.md` and leave only `README.md` / `README_ZH.md` updates linking to the existing Before You Build Skill repository.
- Updated `docs/SUBMISSIONS.md` with the review-response status and follow-up record.

## 2026-06-10 12:22:20 CST

- Opened `cosmicstack-labs/mercury-agent-skills` PR #7 after rechecking that the upstream repository still did not contain `before-you-build`, `bin1874`, or a ClawHub entry.
- Opened `VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills` PR #498 after rechecking that no existing entry or duplicate PR existed, using the required ClawHub link and a one-line README-only change.
- Posted follow-up comments on `OneWave-AI/claude-skills` PR #11 and `yzfly/awesome-claude-skills-zh` Issue #5 after verifying neither repository had already merged or listed the skill.
- Updated `docs/SUBMISSIONS.md` so the promotion tracker reflects the new PRs, follow-ups, and no-longer-blocked submission paths.

## 2026-06-06 22:54:54 CST

- Opened a focused PR to `OneWave-AI/claude-skills` after the maintainer confirmed the pre-build risk gate fit and requested a single-file contribution.
- Submitted only `before-you-build/SKILL.md` in the OneWave fork branch `bin1874:codex/add-before-you-build-lite`, keeping this repository's official full skill package unchanged.
- Updated `docs/SUBMISSIONS.md` to record the maintainer request, PR link, and boundary between the external lightweight adapter and the official Before You Build Skill.

## 2026-06-01 01:04:12 CST

- Continued GitHub ecosystem promotion without waiting for the previous four submissions, while still skipping the highest-gate official repositories such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and GitHub's official catalog.
- Submitted eight additional pull requests to skill directories and OpenClaw/Hermes/Codex ecosystem lists: `intellectronica/awesome-skills`, `RoggeOhta/awesome-codex-cli`, `EthanYolo01/Awesome-OpenClaw`, `LHL3341/awesome-claws`, `rohitg00/awesome-openclaw`, `ZeroPointRepo/awesome-hermes-skills`, `CommandCodeAI/agent-skills`, and `natea/ar-claude-skills`.
- Opened twenty-seven additional GitHub proposal issues across cross-agent skill catalogs, PM/product-skill libraries, OpenClaw directories, Hermes directories, and agent marketplaces.
- Verified all newly created pull requests are open after submission; `CommandCodeAI/agent-skills` also received a proposal issue after retrying a transient GitHub API timeout.

## 2026-06-01 00:43:17 CST

- Re-reviewed the existing GitHub promotion backlog now that `gh` authentication is working again, and prioritized high-fit repositories by contribution clarity, product-skill fit, and risk of low-quality outreach.
- Submitted a PR to `proflead/codex-skills-library` adding a concise `before-you-build` Codex planning skill.
- Opened skill proposal issues for `product-on-purpose/pm-skills` and `phuryn/pm-skills` according to their request-before-PR contribution rules.
- Prepared and validated a `tech-leads-club/agent-skills` Decision Making skill contribution, pushed it to the fork branch, and opened an issue because GitHub rejected cross-repo PR creation for the fork.

## 2026-05-31 09:30:50 CST

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the search mostly resurfaced already-logged venues and did not uncover a stronger genuinely new submission target.
- Logged an Outreach Check-ins entry documenting that `block/agent-skills`, `spencerpauly/awesome-cursor-skills`, `anthropics/skills`, `supabase/agent-skills`, `VoltAgent/awesome-openclaw-skills`, `dotnet/skills`, `MicrosoftDocs/Agent-Skills`, `jdrhyne/agent-skills`, `seb1n/awesome-ai-agent-skills`, `psenger/ai-agent-skills`, and `agent-skills-hub/agent-skills-hub` were re-seen but did not produce a new submission opportunity.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and paused `/Users/hbf/.codex/automations/promote-before-you-build-skill-hourly/automation.toml` locally because the automation had already exceeded its intended five hourly passes and no automation-management tool is exposed in-session.

## 2026-05-31 08:29:17 CST

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the strongest genuinely fresh target this pass was `LHL3341/awesome-claws`.
- Logged `LHL3341/awesome-claws` as blocked because it is a contribution-friendly OpenClaw ecosystem list with a visible `Contributing` section and explicit acceptance criteria for real-world, actively maintained resources.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, GitHub CLI still cannot reach `api.github.com`, and `tool_search` still does not expose any automation-management tool that can disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

## 2026-05-31 07:27:36 CST

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the strongest genuinely fresh target this pass was `rohitg00/awesome-openclaw`.
- Logged `rohitg00/awesome-openclaw` as blocked because it is a contribution-friendly OpenClaw ecosystem list with explicit `Skills & Plugins` coverage and a documented PR flow, and logged `vincentkoc/awesome-openclaw` as deferred because the surfaced page did not show enough repo-specific intake detail or acceptance criteria to outrank the stronger OpenClaw lists already in backlog.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `gh repo view rohitg00/awesome-openclaw`, `gh repo view vincentkoc/awesome-openclaw`, and `gh repo view SamurAIGPT/awesome-openclaw` still fail with `error connecting to api.github.com`.

## 2026-05-31 06:25:56 CST

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the only genuinely fresh repository worth explicit logging was `cloudflare/skills`.
- Logged `cloudflare/skills` as deferred because it is a high-signal contribution-friendly vendor catalog for Cloudflare platform implementation workflows rather than a broad external discovery venue for pre-build product-validation skills.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still does not expose any automation-management tool that can disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the search mostly resurfaced already-logged venues and did not uncover a stronger genuinely new submission target.
- Logged `hashgraph-online/awesome-codex-plugins` as skipped because it is a contribution-friendly Codex directory, but it curates plugin bundles and mirrored marketplace entries rather than standalone third-party `SKILL.md` repositories like Before You Build.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still does not expose any automation-management tool that can disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Logged `agentskills/agentskills` as skipped because it is the Agent Skills specification/documentation repository rather than a third-party listing venue, and logged `hutchic/.cursor` as skipped because it is a personal Cursor configuration/docs repository rather than a community marketplace.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still exposes no automation-management tool that can disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the only genuinely fresh candidate worth logging was `ZeroLu/awesome-openclaw`.
- Logged `ZeroLu/awesome-openclaw` as deferred because it has moderate adoption but the surfaced repository currently reads as a single-README OpenClaw resource guide without a clearly surfaced contribution guide or repo-specific acceptance rules for third-party listings.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` returned no automation-management tool that could disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the only genuinely fresh candidate worth logging was `glebis/claude-skills`.
- Logged `glebis/claude-skills` as skipped because, despite open PR instructions and healthy activity, it presents as a maintainer-owned bundled skill suite with overlapping JTBD/product workflow coverage rather than a stronger neutral community directory or marketplace than the existing backlog.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still did not expose an automation-management tool that could disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

## 2026-05-31 00:20:06 CST

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the only genuinely fresh candidate worth logging was `aiskillstore/marketplace`.
- Logged `aiskillstore/marketplace` as skipped because its README routes third-party submissions through `skillstore.io/submit` and automated off-GitHub review rather than a GitHub issue or pull-request flow, which does not fit this automation's required `gh`-based submission path.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still did not expose an automation-management tool that could disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the strongest genuinely new target this pass was `ZeroPointRepo/awesome-hermes-skills`.
- Logged `ZeroPointRepo/awesome-hermes-skills` as a blocked high-fit directory because its README explicitly welcomes PRs for maintained cross-agent skills with working `SKILL.md`, but this environment still cannot authenticate `gh` or reach `api.github.com` to submit.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still did not expose an automation-management tool to disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directories, registries, and marketplaces; the results only resurfaced already-logged targets, so no genuinely fresh outreach target cleared the bar.
- Logged an Outreach Check-ins entry documenting that `block/agent-skills`, `huggingface/skills`, `the911fund/skill-of-skills`, `product-on-purpose/pm-skills`, and `randroids-dojo/skills` were re-seen but did not produce a new submission opportunity.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directory, skills registry, and skills marketplace repositories; the search mostly resurfaced already-logged backlog targets and one fresh contribution-closed repository.
- Logged `flutter/skills` as skipped because its README explicitly says the Flutter team is not accepting pull requests right now, so it is not a valid third-party submission venue for this automation.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still did not expose a usable automation-management tool to disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Rechecked the submission tracker first, then searched fresh public GitHub results for additional AI agent skill, Claude skill, Cursor skill, Codex skill, OpenClaw skill, `SKILL.md` directory, skills registry, and skills marketplace repositories; the search only resurfaced already-logged backlog targets plus one fresh weak-fit repo.

- Logged `24601/surreal-skills` as skipped because it is a high-quality but single-product SurrealDB skill package already published to registries rather than a broader public directory or marketplace for third-party promotion.
- Confirmed GitHub submission remains blocked because `gh auth status` still reports the `bin1874` token is invalid, and `tool_search` still exposes no automation-management tool to disable the already-overrun hourly automation.

- Confirmed the only newly surfaced repositories worth explicit rejection were `claude-office-skills/skills`, which remains too office-document-execution-specific for this cross-agent product-validation skill, and `runkids/skillshare`, which remains a sync/install utility rather than a public listing destination for third-party skills.

- Updated `LessUp/awesome-claude-skills-zh` PR #1 so it only changes `README.md`; the remaining CI failure now appears to be caused by the repository workflow expecting English README section markers that are absent from the Chinese README.
